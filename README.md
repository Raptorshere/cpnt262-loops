## Code Journal:
 
 The issue of trying to make the objects render on the html page. What I ran into was how the paragraph was not able to get under the heading. Could have used more content in my shape challenge. 

 Intent was: to go for the challenge of 2 shapes and the if/else statement as a key-value pair.
 The conditional statement was not included properly.

 ## FreecodeCamp: I used as source for trying to understand while, for, and do while loops, the summary of information that defined what each one is.
 ## Chatgpt: As well I looked into a bit of Chatgpt to an explanation of if/else statement and statements and expressions, as I was not too familiar by example of what they looked like.
